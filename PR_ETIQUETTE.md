# PR Etiquette

As a contributor to the Dataspace Ecosystem project, we appreciate your efforts in improving our codebase. To ensure a smooth
collaboration and maintain the quality of our project, we kindly ask you to follow these guidelines when submitting or
reviewing pull requests (PRs).

## Etiquette for Authors

* **Familiarize Yourself with the Project**: Before submitting a PR, take some time to understand the project's
  structure, [coding style](STYLE_GUIDE.md), and guidelines. This will help you make changes that align with the
  project's goals and standards.
* **Always have issues linked to your PR**: This helps reviewers understand the context and purpose of the changes. If
  there is no issue, create a discussion to propose your idea and wait until this discussion is converted into an issue.
  For more details, please refer to the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). The reference to the issue should be in
  the title of the PR.
* **Follow the contribution guidelines**: Adhere to the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for submitting PRs. This
  includes following the project's [coding style](STYLE_GUIDE.md), writing clear commit messages, and providing a
  detailed description of
  your changes.
* **Keep PRs Small and Focused**: Try to keep your PRs small and focused on a specific change or feature. This makes it
  easier for reviewers to understand the changes and provide feedback. If you have multiple unrelated changes, consider
  submitting them as separate PRs.
* **Create a Clear and Descriptive PR Title**: Use a title that summarizes the changes made in the PR. This helps
  reviewers understand the purpose of the PR at a glance.
* **Provide a Detailed Description**: In the PR description, explain the changes made, the reasons behind them, and any
  relevant context. This helps reviewers understand the motivation for the changes.
* **3rd party libraries**: If you are adding a new 3rd party library, please ensure that it is compatible with the
  project and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities. Provide a justification for its inclusion in the PR
  description.
* **Add Tests**: If your changes introduce new functionality or modify existing behavior, please add tests to cover
  these changes. This helps ensure that the code remains stable and that any issues are caught early.
* **Run Tests**: Before submitting the PR, run all tests to ensure that your changes do not introduce any new issues.
  This helps maintain the stability of the project and reduces the burden on reviewers.
* **Merge Conflicts should be resolved**: Merge conflicts should be resolved by rebasing onto master and force-pushing.
  Do this when your PR is ready to review.
* **Use Draft PRs for Work in Progress**: If your PR is still a work in progress, consider using a draft PR. This
  indicates to reviewers that the PR is not yet ready for review and allows you to gather feedback on your work as you
  progress.
* **Use Labels**: Use appropriate labels to categorize your PR. This helps reviewers understand the type of changes
  made and prioritize their review.
* **Request Reviews**: When your PR is ready for review, request reviews from at least three project Dataspace Ecosystem
  developers. This helps ensure that your changes are reviewed by several people and that any issues are caught early.
* **Re-request review**: If you make changes to the PR based on feedback, re-request a review from the reviewers. This
  helps ensure that your changes are reviewed in a timely manner and that any issues are addressed promptly.
* **Be Open to Feedback**: Be receptive to feedback from reviewers and be willing to make changes based on their
  suggestions. This fosters a collaborative environment and helps improve the quality of the codebase.
* **Code of Conduct**: Familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensure that your
  contributions align with our values. This helps create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Etiquette for Reviewers

* **Be Timely**: Aim to review PRs in a timely manner. This helps keep the development process moving forward and
  prevents bottlenecks in the workflow.
* **If you cannot review the PR, please unassign yourself**: If you are unable to review a PR for any reason, please
  unassign yourself from the PR and assign another developer. This helps keep the review process moving and allows other
  reviewers to step in.
* **Do not be overly critical**: While it is important to provide constructive feedback, avoid being overly critical or
  harsh in your comments. Focus on the code and the changes made, rather than personal opinions or preferences.
* **Be Thorough**: Review the code thoroughly, checking for issues such as bugs, performance problems, and adherence to
  coding standards. This helps ensure that the codebase remains high-quality and maintainable.
* **Be Respectful and Constructive**: Provide feedback in a respectful and constructive manner. Focus on the code and
  the changes made, rather than personal opinions or preferences.
* **Ask Questions**: If something is unclear, or you need more information, ask the author for clarification. This helps
  ensure that you fully understand the changes made in the PR.
* **Provide Context**: When suggesting changes or improvements, provide context for your suggestions. Explain why you
  believe the changes are necessary and how they can improve the codebase.
* **Be Open to Discussion**: Be open to discussing the changes made in the PR and consider the author's perspective.
  Collaboration and open communication are key to a successful review process.
* **Acknowledge Good Work**: If you notice well-written code or a particularly good solution, take a moment to
  acknowledge it. Positive feedback can motivate authors and foster a positive atmosphere in the project.
* **Follow Code of Conduct**: Familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and ensure that your
  reviews align with our values. This helps create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.
